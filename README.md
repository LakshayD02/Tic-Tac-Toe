# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python

This is a console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python. The game supports two players who can alternate turns, and the game board is dynamically displayed after each move. It also includes a scoreboard to track the number of wins for each player across multiple rounds of play.

# Features:

- Two-Player Gameplay: Players can alternate turns, with Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
- Dynamic Game Board: The Tic-Tac-Toe grid updates visually after each move.
- Input Validation: Ensures players make valid moves, such as choosing empty spots within the grid.
- Win Detection: The game checks all possible winning combinations after each move.
- Draw Detection: The game recognizes when all spots are filled, and no player has won (draw).
- Scoreboard: Keeps track of the score, displaying how many rounds each player has won.
- Game Continuation: After each round, players can continue playing or quit the game. The final scores are displayed when the game ends.

# How to Play:

- Run the script, and enter the names of Player 1 and Player 2.
- Each player selects whether they will play as X or O.
- Players take turns choosing a spot on the 3x3 board (spots are numbered 1-9).
- The game checks if a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
- After each game, the scoreboard is updated, and players can choose to play again or quit.
